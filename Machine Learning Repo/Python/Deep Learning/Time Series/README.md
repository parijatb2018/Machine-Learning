I have published a two-parts-article in medium.com and later also published the same on analyticsvidhya.com on request.

In this article I have created my own data from latest Google and Spotify stock price to discuss time series-related terms and used Airline Passenger data from Kaggle to compare
results of ARIMA( and SARIMA), Auto-ARIMA, and RNN(LSTM).

Please find the links below. I have also shared the Kaggle kernels links in my articles.
