Everybody grove to the music
Everybody jam

Oh, hey

We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go
If you really wanna see
What we can do for you
Send the crazy wildin' static
Sing it

[Chorus:]
Jam on cuz Backstreet's got it
Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
[2x]

We've got it goin' on for years [2x]

Well I'm creepin' up on your left
Straight up funky when I get with you
Keep it ruthless when I get wet
Keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype
Get up on this just to get right
What you want it what you gonna get
Backstreet's got the special effects, uh

If you really wanna see
What we can do for you, oh
I'll send the crazy wildin' static
Sing it

We've got it goin' on for years [2x]

Jam on, jam on

Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam

[Chorus]

We've got it goin' on



I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to

I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way believe me
Even through the darkest night you know

[Chorus:]
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world
To know

[Chorus]

Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, oh [3x]

[Chorus 2x]
You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

Hey, yeah

[Chorus:]
Get down
Get down
And move it all around
[2x]

Hey baby love I need a girl like you
But tell me if you feel it too
I'm in delusion every minute every hour
My heart is crying out for you

[Bridge:]
I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
I know that you are the one for me (one for me)
You drive me crazy cuz
You're one of a kind
I want your lovin'
And I want it right now

[Chorus (2x)]

[Refrain:]
Ooh baby you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

[Spoken:]
Baby, I know you're hurting
Right now you feel like you could never
Love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you

From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would
Be together forever
Ooh when I asked you out
You said no but I found out
Darling that you'd been hurt
You felt like you'd never love again
I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey he' s nothing like me

[Chorus:]
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie
[2x]

As time goes by
You will get to know me
A little more better
Girl that's the way love goes baby, baby
And I (I) know you're afraid (know you're afraid)
To let your feelings show (feelings show)
And I understand
Girl, it's time to let go (girl, it's time to let go because)
I deserve a try (try) honey
Just once (once)
Give me a chance (chance) and I'll prove this all wrong (wrong you walked)
You walked in, you were so quick to judge (quick to judge)
But honey he's nothing like me
Darling why can't you see

[Chorus (2x)]

[Bridge:]
No way, no how (I'll never break your heart girl, I'll never make you cry)
I swear (Oh I, oh I, I swear)
No way, no how (I'll never break your heart girl, I'll never make you cry)

[Chorus (3x)]
Baby, oh

Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad baby
Quit playin' games with my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart (with my heart)
Before you tear us apart (my heart)
Quit playin' games with my heart
I should've known from the start
You know you've gotta stop (from my heart)
You're tearin' us apart (my heart, my heart)
Quit playin' games with my heart

I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time,
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
You better quit playin' games with my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart (with my heart)
Before you tear us apart (my heart)

When it comes to me
Like to know what's in your mind
It's not easy to see
I know now what I feel
And what to do

And I'll be waitin'
Until you face the truth
When the light is fadin'
You know what I wanna do

And I'll be waitin'
Until you face the truth
When the light is fadin'

Everytime I close my eyes

Listen girl I don't know where to start
But every word I say comes straight from the heart
I've been so wrong
I never meant to hurt you
Oh girl, I'm sorry
For what I put you through
Girl I'd do anything
For one more chance (one more chance)
Cuz I want you back again (want you back)

[Chorus:]
Cuz everytime I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes
Do you think about me?
Now I realize
I want you girl and no other
Everytime I close my eyes
You're all that I see

You and I shared a life together
Each other, was all we'd ever need (all we'd ever need)
I thought you would stay with me forever
But I took for granted
The love you gave to me
I keep on tryin' (keep on tryin')
'Til the end ('til the end)
Baby I need you back with me again (I need you back)

[Chorus]

And girl I'm goin' out of my mind
I miss you so much
I don't know what to do (what to do)
Please say it's just a matter of time
Until I feel your touch
Until you let me come back to you I'm in love with you

I think about you girl everynight
I'm in love and it feels so right
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain
I was just caught up in that lying game
But now those days are over
I've changed my ways
And now I'm countin' the minutes
I'm countin' the days
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start
To find a new way to get back into your heart

Girl I'd do anything for one more chance (one more chance)
Cuz I want you
I want you back again (I want you back)

[Chorus]
[Spoken:]
Baby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If your words had meaning
If you really cared about me
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart
If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why
Would you turn away from my love

[Chorus:]
So darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right
Darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right
Darlin'
Tell me what to do to make things right for love
Tell me what to do to make things right for love (for love)

If your words have reason
When they won't turn away from me
They're trying hard to hide all truth they might say
If you listen to me girl
If you know how I'm feeling inside
Then maybe you wouldn't shut me out your life, baby

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Can't you see?
All I'm asking for
Is a chance to let me love you
Can't you see?
Girl, you know with me
Is where you should be
And if by chance we should find
That it can be for you and I
Then girl I'll try
I'll try
Oh baby

[Chorus]

[Spoken:]
Girl, you should know how I feel by now
There's so many ways to love
So just open your heart
And I'll find the way

[Bridge]
