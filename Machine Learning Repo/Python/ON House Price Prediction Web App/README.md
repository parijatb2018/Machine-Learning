<h1>Ontario House Price Prediction App</h1>                                                                                                                     
<p>An end-to-end data science project where a web app was developed, predicting average house prices at different cities in Ontario based on some user inputs. This Flask framework-based web app, deployed (as a docker image with required files and dependencies on AWS EC2), consumed an ensemble ML model of Lasso regression, KNN, and RF. On the front-end, HTML, CSS, and Jinja templates were used to retrieve the user data and furnish the output. Finally, the result was shown on the google map for the inputted address in ON, along with the four additional prices of similar neighbourhood houses in a 1.5 km radius so that the buyer gets a clear picture of price vs value for money while deciding on the house.<br>
Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Places API(Geocoding), Gmaps.js, Docker, AWS EC2, Linux

Data was provided by a real estate company in Toronto.
